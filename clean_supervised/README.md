##Supervised Learning Algorithm
These files scrub the data and run the supervised learning algorithm used to classify iPhones into 
their various model categories (4/4s/5/5c/etc.).

##Purpose


##Implementation  
The supervised learning classification was a two-step process: a machine learning classifier and regular expressions. The initial classification was binary (iPhone/not iPhone) using the Naive Bayes algorithm. Other supervised learning techniques were considered such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines, but the Naive Bayes algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and transparency. The second step in the process is a regular expression waterfall where iPhones are classified based on various text patterns.
