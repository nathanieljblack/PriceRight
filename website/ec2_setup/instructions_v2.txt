1. Do "git pull" to get the latest updates from our project repository

2. Start a terminal and run…  sudo mongod

3. On separate terminal, run…  mongo      <— this opens the mongo console

4. Inside the mongo console, type the following:
  use w205project          <— create a database
  db.createCollection('listing_sups')
  db.createCollection('listing_unsups')
  db.createCollection('products')
  db.createCollection('locations')

5. On a seprate terminal, go to the "website/data" folder and run...   python load.py
(this step will take a while, say 3-5min, since it's loading data from S3)

6. Go to "website/public" and run...  node server.js

7. Open a web browser (I recommend using Chrome) and type "localhost:8000" into the url link area. It should then run! 

Note that on the website there is a button called "NLP mode". It's not functional yet, I can explain
